SerializeWithOptions
====================

This plugin is designed to make creating XML and JSON APIs for your Rails apps dead simple. We noticed a lot of repetition when creating API responses in our controllers. With this plugin, you can set the serialization options for a model with a simple DSL, rather than repeating them in every controller that includes it.


Example
-------

Here is a simple example of SerializeWithOptions in action:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :posts

      serialize_with_options do
        methods   :post_count
        includes  :posts
        except    :email
      end

      serialize_with_options(:with_email) do
        methods   :post_count
        includes  :posts
      end

      def post_count
        self.posts.count
      end
    end

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :comments
      belongs_to :user

      serialize_with_options do
        only      :title
        includes  :user, :comments
      end
    end

    class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :post
    end

With these directives in place, we can call `@post.to_xml` (or `@post.to_json`) and it's as if we entered:

    @post.to_xml(:include => { :user => { :methods => :post_count, :except => :email }, :comments => { } })

In our controller, we can just say:

    def show
      @post = Post.find(params[:id])

      respond_to do |format|
        format.html
        format.xml { render :xml => @post }
        format.json { render :json => @post }
      end
    end

All serialization options are enclosed in a `serialize_with_options` block. There are four options, lifted directly from ActiveRecord's [serialization API][ser]: `methods` are the methods to add to the default attributes, `only` are the attributes to include, excluding all others, `except` are the attributes to leave out, and `includes` are the associated models.

If an included model has its own `serialize_with_options` block, its `methods`, `only`, and `except` will be respected. However, the included model's `includes` directive will be ignored (only one level of nesting is supported). If you need more than one level of nesting, you can use a hash to set your included models, rather than an array.

The `serialize_with_options` class method takes an optional argument for naming a configuration set (see the User model above). This is useful if you need to multiple serialization configuration sets. You can access these secondary configuration sets by passing the set name to the serialization method, e.g., `@post.to_xml(:with_email)`.


Installation
------------

Simply add "`serialize_with_options`" to your Gemfile:
